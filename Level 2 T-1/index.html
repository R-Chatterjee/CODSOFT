                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Bengali parents Prabhabati Bose 
                    and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack—in what is today the state of Odisha in India, 
                    but was then part of the Bengal Presidency in British India.Following his five older brothers, Bose entered the 
                    Baptist Mission's Protestant European School in Cuttack in January 1902 then Ravenshaw Collegiate School in Cuttack in 1909.
                    He was excellent in academics therefore in 1912, he secured the second position in the matriculation examination conducted under the auspices of the University of Calcutta.
                    He came fourth in the ICS examination and was selected, but he did not want to work under British government. As he stood on the verge of taking the plunge by 
                    resigning from the Indian Civil Service in 1921, he wrote to his elder brother Sarat Chandra Bose: "Only on the soil of sacrifice and suffering can we raise our national edifice". 
                    He then resigned from his civil service job on 23 April 1921 and returned to India.

                <p>
                    On 16 July 1921, Subhas Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi met in Bombay and had differing views on their approaches in achieving independence. 
                    Gandhi emphasized non-violence, while Bose believed in using any means necessary. 
                    Under Chittaranjan Das's mentorship, Bose founded the newspaper Swaraj and became a significant figure in the 
                    Bengal Provincial Congress Committee in 1922. He held various leadership roles, including President of the Indian Youth Congress 
                    and Secretary of the Bengal State Congress, and was imprisoned multiple times for his activism. 
                    Despite these setbacks, Bose continued to play a crucial role in the independence movement, becoming the Mayor of Calcutta in 1930.

                    Indian National Army
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During World War II, Germans and Japanese forces (Axis Powers) were against Britishers. 
                    Bose saw an opportunity and asked for help. Germans refused. Japanese forces anyway wanted to attack the 
                    British forces so they were ready to help Netaji out. They played smartly and instead of sending their own men, 
                    they put forward the Indian soldiers who were fighting for Britishers and were caught during Battle of Singapore.
                    This army unit completely lost their motivation and believed that they were mere scapegoats and were being used 
                    for the greed of power. But as soon as Bose took control of this force every thing changed. 
                    He called this army unit आज़ाद हिन्द फौज - <b>The Indian National Army (INA)</b>. He motivated them, established a 
                    purpose for them that is to free India from Britishraj through his speeches. One of his famous slogan 
                    includes “तुम मुझे खून दो, मैं तुम्हे आज़ादी दूंगा।”. Bose also formed an All Women Regiment - रानी झाँसी रेजिमेंट <b>
                    (Rani-Jhansi Regiment)</b> and handed over the command of INA to three incredible commanders Shah Nawaz, 
                    Dhillon, Sahgal. These 3 took INA from Singapore to Imphal were they encountered British Army which was 
                    full of Indian Soldiers. But unfortunately British army ruthlessly defeated INA and in May, 1945 INA surrendered.

                    Bose died in a plane crash in Taiwan on 18 August, 1945. When whole India was mourning the death of Netaji, 
                    Britishers tried to launch a psychological attack on the Indians. So they decided to conduct a public trial 
                    on the three commanders of Netaji. This was held on 5 November, 1945. They marketed this trail through press 
                    and called it <b>Red Fort Trials</b>. But the ensuing media attention of the case, resulted in many Indians 
                    getting acquainted with a force that had fought for independence. It led to sympathy for the INA across the 
                    country parts in solidarity with the captured troops.Moment the Indian soldiers in the British army came to know 
                    about the INA all these soldiers including the Navy started revolting and as the news spread it started snowballing
                    into a rebellion that the Britishers had neverseen before. This event is famously known as <b>The Naval Mutiny of 
                    1946</b>. It had such a ripple effect that within no time in 1946 a cabinet mission is set up which stated the 
                    transfer of power. Interim government was formed on 20 February, 1947 and India got it's independence on 
                    15 August, 1947.</p>

                    <span>An Inspiration For</span><span>Generations To Come</span>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 1956, the former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee in a conversation with Governor of Bengal said that the role played by Netaji's army was paramount in India being granted Independence, while the role played by the Non-Violent movement was minimal. 
    
                    And this one statement itself is enough to question the version of history taught in our school textbooks. 
                            
                    Upcoming generations must be taught about INA and their significant contribution to India's Independence. Bose's legacy must continue to inspire the younger generation to strive for a better India.
